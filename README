This is (almost) the bare minimum to get a blinking LED on a STM32F4-Discovery board

Works with the Codesourcery toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc (Sourcery CodeBench Lite 2011.09-69) 4.6.1)


Three Step Guide:

 cd blink
 ./build.sh
 ./flash main.elf


Most headers are copied from CMSIS and STM's libs, startup is from XPCC (and sligthly modified).
